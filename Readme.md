### General

#### How to stay focused?
- A friend of mine itroduced this method to me: E.g 50min learning --> 10min break --> 50min learning --> and so on...  
Everybody has to find his own rythm regarding the intervalls but 50/10 is a good value to start with.

## Usefully

- [DeepL Translate](https://www.deepl.com/translator)
- [Remove from from remote repository after adding them to .gitignore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7927230/remove-directory-from-remote-repository-after-adding-them-to-gitignore)

  ```
  git rm -r --cached . 
  git add .
  git commit -m 'Removed all files that are in the .gitignore' 
  git push origin master
  ```

- [Markdown Resisze Image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14675913/changing-image-size-in-markdown)
  ```
  With certain Markdown implementations (including Mou and Marked 2 (only macOS)) you can append =WIDTHxHEIGHT after the URL of the graphic file to resize the image. Do not forget the space before the =.

  ![](./pic/pic1_50.png =100x20)
  You can skip the HEIGHT

  ![](./pic/pic1s.png =250x)
  ```

  ```
  You could just use some HTML in your Markdown:

  <img src="drawing.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
  Or via style attribute (not supported by GitHub)

  <img src="drawing.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:200px;"/>
  Or you could use a custom CSS file as described in this answer on Markdown and image alignment

  ![drawing](drawing.jpg)
  CSS in another file:

  img[alt=drawing] { width: 200px; }
  ```

- [How to force a line break in Markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26626256/how-to-insert-a-line-break-br-in-markdown)  
  ```
  Try adding 2 spaces (or a backslash \) after the first line:

  Add after line end: <br></p>

  [Name of link](url)
  My line of text\
  Visually:

  [Name of link](url)<space><space>
  My line of text\
  Output:

  <p><a href="url">Name of link</a><br>
  My line of text<br></p>
  ```

  One of favorites is the multi line editing feature: `alt+cmb+up/down` or `alt+click`

- Pandas: Add new column by defining the range on an existing column. 
  ```
  df.loc[df['Age'] > 70, 'Age_group'] = 'Adult'
  df.loc[((df['Age'] < 30) & (df['Age'] > 10)), 'Age_group'] = 'Mid_age'
  ```
