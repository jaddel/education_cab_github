#### Task 2 Statistics
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://tanthiamhuat.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/pythondatasciencehandbook.pdf)
  - Machine Learning Pages 331 - 342
- [The 8 Basic Statistics Concepts for Data Science](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/06/8-basic-statistics-conceptshtml)
  - [The same but more friendly to read](sprint_2/8_Basic_Statistic_Concepts.pdf)
- [Basic Statistics](https://dsft.code-data-ai.com/stats-1/)
- There are two major branches of statistics- Descriptive and Inferential. 
   >Descriptive statistics helps to analyse data by describing or summarizing data in a meaningful way. It might lookfor some patterns which can help to reach conclusion about the data, however, it does not draw any conclusionbeyond the data or about any hypotheses. There comes Inferential statistics which provides techniques that candraw a small sample from a large population to make generalizations about that population and also performhypothesis testing to determine relationships between two datasets.

#### Task 3 Machine Learning 
  - [Machine Learning Kaggle zeddee's Github](https://gist.github.com/zeddee/824cfa865bd2944057a49bf2fd6e4b65)
  - [Youtube: Keith Galli Machine Learning Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Itm95JzL0)
  - Underfitting & Overfitting
    - Overfitting: capturing spurious patterns that won't recur in the future, leading to less accurate predictions, or
    - Underfitting: failing to capture relevant patterns, again leading to less accurate predictions.
  - [Commonly used machine learning algorithms (this was very helpful for me)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/common-machine-learning-algorithms/)  
    - Major focus on commonly used machine learning algorithms
    - Algorithms covered- Linear regression, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, kNN, Random forest, etc.
    - Learn both theory and implementation of these algorithms in R and python
